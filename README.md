 If you… live in town, have children but not much time The Bichon Frise fits the bill in this instance.    ‘Well that’s the last time I buy supermarket-own shampoo…’ The inimitable Bichon Frise. ©Lisa Croft-Elliott / Kennel Club  They’re described by the Kennel Club as ‘an ideal companion dog’ but one which ‘loves to be part of the family.’ They’re friendly and loveable, and they’ll even save you time hoovering: their coats barely shed any hair.  If you… live in town, don’t have children and not much time Let’s be honest: this particular breed will be a fairly niche choice among Country Life readers. And yet Chihuahuas deserve to have their fans as dogs which are as big of personality as they are small of stature.    Is this the first time a Chihuahua has been pictured in Country Life? ©Diane Pearce / Kennel Club  ‘Chihuahuas are compact, alert and spirited little dogs – although tiny they are brimming with personality,’ say the Kennel Club. ‘They’re very adaptable and suitable for city-living.’  If even the energy levels of the Chihuahua are a bit too much then the Kennel Club recommend a Maltese or Miniature Schnauzer — small, self-reliant dogs who’ll be happy when left to their own devices.
